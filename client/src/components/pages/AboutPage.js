          Earrings are more than just accessories. They are confidence boosters.
          They are mood changers. They are statement pieces that can help us
          express how we feel. When I approach a new collection, my first
          thought is, "will this piece make someone happy?" I truly hope that
          every time you wear Clay Dazing earrings that it brings a smile
          ear-to-ear.

          As for my Clay Storyâ€”Iâ€™m Maria, creator, and owner of Clay Dazing. I
          started making polymer clay earrings in 2020 as a fun hobby and stress
          reliever and fell completely in love with the craft. After posting
          some of my first pieces to my personal social media, there was a
          decent interest and thus, Clay Dazing was born. And I am so thankful
          you are here for it. ðŸ’—
